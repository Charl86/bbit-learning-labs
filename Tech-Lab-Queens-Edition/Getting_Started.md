# Getting Started

The `your-nextjs-app` will be your main working directory. In order to run your webapp, follow the instructions below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Technical Requirements
- Docker
- Node

### Install Docker

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):

2. First, build and run your application containers.

```docker composer up```

This docker command will run the following commands (`npm install` && `npm run dev`) to start your web application in addition to running a local backend server for your application API services. 

3. Next, open another terminal window and cd in your local project folder where you will begin you work (in the `your-nextjs-app`):

```cd your-nextjs-app```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the UI of your web application.
