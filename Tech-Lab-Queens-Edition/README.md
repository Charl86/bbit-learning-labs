## Rationale

Here at Bloomberg, we wanted to give individual a better insight into what software engineering looks like and how we build our software solutions. This repo contains a series of labs which will walk through & engage developers to create solutions to problems we face at Bloomberg! Through these labs you can learn more about our problem domain and continue to develop your coding skills.

## Framework

This lab follows a framework of learning items. Each learning item should have a goal/objective for the developer to complete. Objective items can build off each other allowing the developer to use their previous code in new problem sets. Each learning item item has set of **developer provided solutions**

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability in this project, please send email to the project
team at opensource@bloomberg.net, detailing the suspected issue and any methods you've found to reproduce it.

Please do NOT open an issue in the GitHub repository, as we'd prefer to keep vulnerability reports private until
we've had an opportunity to review and address them.

## Getting Started

The `your-nextjs-app` will be your main working directory. In order to run your webapp, follow the instructions below.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Technical Requirements
- Docker
- Git
- Node

### Installing Git

In order to easily download the most up-to-date version of this repository, you will be interested in downloading [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once you have downloaded and installed Git, you should be able to clone this repository.

### Install Docker

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. First, build and run your application containers.

```docker composer up```
* This docker command will run the following commands (`npm install` && `npm run dev`) to start your web application in addition to running a local backend server for your application API services. 

3. Next, open another terminal window and cd in your local project folder where you will begin you work (in the `your-nextjs-app`):

```cd PortfolioManager/your-nextjs-app```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the UI of your web application.
